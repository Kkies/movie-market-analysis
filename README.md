## Problem
- Microsoft is starting a movie studio and needs insight on what type of movie they should make

- Which team should we build? 
- Considering COVID-19, would an online release be better?

- Most Twitter users we queried were actually conflicted on going back to theatres/theatre reopening. We need more data to be able to answer whether an online release would be better.

## Recommendations
- We found that the best genres to consider would be Animation, Adventure, and Sci-Fi.
- The best time to premier is end of June to mid July.
- Our top actor and actress was Mark Ruffalo and Natalie Portman. Steven Spielberg should direct and John Williams should compose the score.
- More research should be done on Twitter sentiment for reopening during COVID-19. Perhaps a sentiment analysis would help.
