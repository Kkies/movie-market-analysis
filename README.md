## Introduction - Our Questions 
- What genre is best? 
- When should we premier 'Microsoft Studios'? 
- Which team should we build? 
- Considering COVID-19, would an online release be better?

## Observations

- Although animation comes in last for top 10 number of movies produced, it comes in top 5 for cumulative revenue. In addition, each decade of animation release has significantly   increasing amount of revenue.
- While May seems to be a good month for revenue, it is not a good month for longevity.

- A wide array of actors, actresses, directors, and composers would make for a great movie production.

- Most Twitter users we queried were actually conflicted on going back to theatres/theatre reopening.

## Recommendations
- We found that the best genres to consider would be Animation, Adventure, and Sci-Fi.
- The best time to premier is end of June to mid July.
- Our top actor and actress was Mark Ruffalo and Natalie Portman. Steven Spielberg should direct and John Williams should compose the score.
- More research should be done on Twitter sentiment for reopening during COVID-19. Perhaps a sentiment analysis would help.
